# Comparison Operators in Python

# Equal to (==)
# Checks if the values of two operands are equal
a, b = 5, 5
print(f'{a} == {b}: {a == b}')

# Not equal to (!=)
# Checks if the values of two operands are not equal
a, b = 5, 3
print(f'{a} != {b}: {a != b}')

# Greater than (>)
# Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand
a, b = 5, 3
print(f'{a} > {b}: {a > b}')

# Less than (<)
# Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand
a, b = 5, 3
print(f'{a} < {b}: {a < b}')

# Greater than or equal to (>=)
# Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand
a, b = 5, 5
print(f'{a} >= {b}: {a >= b}')

# Less than or equal to (<=)
# Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand
a, b = 3, 5
print(f'{a} <= {b}: {a <= b}')

# These operators compare the values on either side of them and decide the relation among them.
# They are also called relational operators.
