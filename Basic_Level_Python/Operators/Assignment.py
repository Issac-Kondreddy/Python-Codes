# Assignment Operators in Python

# Simple assignment (=)
# Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand
a = 10
print(f'a = {a}')

# Add AND (+=)
# It adds right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to left operand
a += 5  # Equivalent to a = a + 5
print(f'a after a += 5: {a}')

# Subtract AND (-=)
# It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to left operand
a -= 2  # Equivalent to a = a - 2
print(f'a after a -= 2: {a}')

# Multiply AND (*=)
# It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to left operand
a *= 2  # Equivalent to a = a * 2
print(f'a after a *= 2: {a}')

# Divide AND (/=)
# It divides left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to left operand
a /= 4  # Equivalent to a = a / 4
print(f'a after a /= 4: {a}')

# Modulus AND (%=)
# It takes modulus using two operands and assigns the result to left operand
a = 10
a %= 3  # Equivalent to a = a % 3
print(f'a after a %= 3: {a}')

# Exponent AND (**=)
# Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators and assign value to the left operand
a **= 2  # Equivalent to a = a ** 2
print(f'a after a **= 2: {a}')

# Floor Division (//=)
# It performs floor division on operators and assigns value to the left operand
a //= 2  # Equivalent to a = a // 2
print(f'a after a //= 2: {a}')

# These operators are used to perform various operations on variables and values.
