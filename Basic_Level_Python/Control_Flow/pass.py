# Pass Statement in Python

# The pass statement is a null statement in Python. It's a placeholder for future code.

# Example of pass statement
for num in range(10):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        pass  # Will do something here later
    else:
        print(num)

# Pass statement in a function
def my_function():
    pass  # An empty function definition

# The pass statement allows for the creation of minimal classes, functions, and loops without any implementation, which can be useful for defining a structure or a future implementation.
